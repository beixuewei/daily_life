There are two kinds of lidar localization: pure lidar, and lidar fused with RTK
The disadvantages:
1) lidar map will be invalid when the environment change, such as change of season, windy day;
2) Do not support high speed case;
3) pure lidar localization is inexact in case of which feature point is few and scattered;
4) dynamic environment will affect its acurrency.

how to solve:
1) there are no solution yet;
2) eliminate rotation of point cloud;
3) optimize lidar map
4) filter dynamic obstacle
